3. Replit Ghost Writer → Regression tests
4. Claude → Review & verify

### Performance Optimization:
1. Claude → Performance analysis
2. GPT Engineer → Optimization implementation
3. Replit Ghost Writer → Performance tests
4. Claude → Verification & integration

## Troubleshooting

If a tool generates incorrect or incomplete code:
1. Return to Claude with the specific issues
2. Get refined requirements or constraints
3. Try another tool with the refined specifications
4. Have Claude review the new output

## Success Metrics

Track these metrics for each development task:
1. Number of iterations needed
2. Quality of generated code
3. Time saved vs manual coding
4. Integration success rate
5. Bug rate in generated code

## Regular Review

Every 2 weeks:
1. Review tool effectiveness
2. Update prompt templates
3. Refine workflow patterns
4. Document new best practices

Remember: This is an iterative process. Adjust the workflow based on your project's specific needs and the effectiveness of each tool for different types of tasks.

## Practical Example

Let's walk through implementing a new feature using this workflow:

### Task Example: "Add a user authentication system"

1. **Start with Claude:**
   ```
   "I need to implement a user authentication system for this project. Please:
   1. Analyze the current codebase structure
   2. Identify where auth components should be placed
   3. Outline the necessary files and changes
   4. Suggest the best authentication approach"
   ```

2. **Use GPT Engineer for Implementation:**
   ```
   "Generate a complete authentication system implementation with:
   1. User registration and login endpoints
   2. Password hashing and validation
   3. JWT token management
   4. Session handling
   Based on Claude's architecture: [paste Claude's response]"
   ```

3. **Use Cascade for Login UI:**
   ```
   "Create a responsive login/register interface that:
   1. Includes forms for login and registration
   2. Shows validation errors
   3. Handles loading states
   4. Provides password reset functionality"
   ```

4. **Back to Claude for Review:**
   ```
   "Review this generated authentication implementation:
   1. [Paste all generated code]
   2. Focus on security best practices
   3. Verify JWT implementation
   4. Check for potential vulnerabilities"
   ```

5. **Use Replit Ghost Writer for Tests:**
   ```
   "Generate comprehensive tests for this auth system:
   1. [Paste final implementation]
   2. Include tests for:
      - User registration
      - Login/logout flows
      - Password reset
      - Token validation
      - Security edge cases"
   ```

6. **Final Integration with Claude:**
   ```
   "Please:
   1. Review all auth components
   2. Verify security measures
   3. Confirm test coverage
   4. Suggest any final security improvements"
   ```

This example demonstrates how to chain the tools together effectively, passing context between them to build a complete feature.

## Version Control & Code Management

### Git Workflow for AI-Generated Code

1. **Branch Strategy**
   ```bash
   # Create feature branch
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]
   
   # Create sub-branches for each AI tool
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]/claude-design
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]/gpt-implementation
   git checkout -b feature/[feature-name]/cascade-ui
   ```

2. **Commit Structure**
   ```bash
   # Commit message format
   [AI Tool] - [Component] - [Action]
   
   # Examples:
   git commit -m "Claude - Auth System - Initial Architecture"
   git commit -m "GPT Engineer - Auth API - Implementation"
   git commit -m "Cascade - Login UI - Component Generation"
   ```

3. **Code Review Process**
   - Tag commits with AI tool that generated them
   - Include original prompts in commit descriptions
   - Reference tracking document in PR description
   - Link related commits across tools

### Code Organization

1. **File Structure**
   ```
   feature/
   ├── design/
   │   └── claude-architecture.md
   ├── implementation/
   │   ├── gpt-generated/
   │   └── cascade-ui/
   ├── tests/
   │   └── replit-tests/
   └── tracking.md
   ```

2. **Documentation**
   - Keep AI prompts with generated code
   - Document tool-specific configurations
   - Track changes between iterations

### Integration Guidelines

1. **Code Review Checklist**
   - Verify consistency across AI-generated components
   - Check integration points between tools
   - Validate error handling across boundaries
   - Ensure consistent naming conventions

2. **Merge Strategy**
   - Review changes from each AI tool separately
   - Merge in logical order (e.g., core implementation before UI)
   - Resolve conflicts with Claude's assistance
   - Run full test suite after each merge

This version control strategy helps maintain clean, traceable code when working with multiple AI tools.

## Error Handling & Debugging Across Tools

### Common Error Patterns

1. **Integration Errors**
   - Mismatched interfaces between tools
   - Inconsistent data structures
   - Different naming conventions
   
   Solution: Use Claude to review and standardize interfaces before integration

2. **Quality Issues**
   - Inconsistent code style
   - Duplicate functionality
   - Missing error handling
   
   Solution: Run generated code through standardization review with Claude

3. **Logic Conflicts**
   - Different tools implementing same logic differently
   - Conflicting business rules
   - Incompatible approaches
   
   Solution: Maintain single source of truth in tracking document

### Debugging Strategy

1. **Isolate the Source**
   ```
   Ask Claude:
   "Review this error occurring between [Tool A] and [Tool B]:
   1. Identify which tool's output is causing the issue
   2. Analyze the integration point
   3. Suggest specific fixes"
   ```

2. **Cross-Tool Validation**
   - Compare outputs between tools
   - Verify assumptions made by each tool
   - Check for environmental differences

3. **Progressive Testing**
   ```
   1. Test each tool's output independently
   2. Test integration points in isolation
   3. Test complete feature end-to-end
   ```

### Recovery Procedures

1. **Code Generation Issues**
   - Save all intermediate outputs
   - Document tool-specific limitations
   - Maintain fallback implementations

2. **Integration Failures**
   - Roll back to last known good state
   - Re-generate problematic components
   - Use Claude for conflict resolution

3. **Performance Problems**
   - Profile each tool's output separately
   - Identify bottlenecks at integration points
   - Optimize critical paths first

### Prevention Best Practices

1. **Clear Boundaries**
   - Define tool responsibilities upfront
   - Document expected inputs/outputs
   - Establish validation checkpoints

2. **Consistent Standards**
   - Use same coding style across tools
   - Maintain consistent naming conventions
   - Follow unified error handling patterns

3. **Regular Validation**
   - Review integration points frequently
   - Test cross-tool functionality
   - Monitor performance metrics

This systematic approach to error handling helps maintain stability when working with multiple AI tools.
