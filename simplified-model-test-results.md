## Previous Implementation Issues
1. **Temperature Effect Bug:**

   - Exponential function not actually used
   - Results in oversimplified altitude effects

3. **Code vs. Physics Discrepancies:**
   - Temperature ratios in lookup table have wrong progression
   - Air density effects not properly integrated
   - Missing temperature-density relationship
   - Humidity impact completely ignored

## Model Analysis

### Temperature Effects
1. Linear scaling of ~3% per 20°F difference from standard (70°F)
   - ✅ Simple to understand and implement
   - ✅ Provides reasonable approximations near standard conditions
   - ❌ Doesn't account for non-linear effects at temperature extremes
   - ❌ Ignores ball construction's influence on temperature sensitivity

2. Effect is symmetrical for hot and cold temperatures
   - ✅ Makes model behavior predictable
   - ❌ Real golf balls don't behave symmetrically with temperature
   - ❌ Cold temperatures have additional effects on ball properties

3. Minimal effect near standard temperature
   - ✅ Appropriate for small temperature variations
   - ❌ Doesn't consider cumulative effects with other conditions

### Altitude Effects
1. Linear scaling of 5% per 1000 feet
   - ✅ Easy to calculate and understand
   - ❌ Real atmosphere follows exponential density decrease

2. Significant impact on distance (+25% at 5000 feet)
   - ❌ Overestimates altitude benefit
   - ❌ Doesn't consider reduced spin effectiveness
   - ❌ Ignores changes in optimal launch conditions
