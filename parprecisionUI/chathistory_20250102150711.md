## Conversation Summary (Focusing on Weather & Calculation Issues)

### 1. Real-Time Weather Data Not Displaying Correctly

• The user discovered their shot calculator was, in fact, using correct weather data (e.g., 58°F), but the UI continued to show a default/hardcoded 70°F.  
• Common reasons:  
  - Stale or hardcoded placeholder values (e.g., “70°F” in a component).  
  - The UI referencing outdated state or a cached fallback.  
  - Missing re-renders if the weather data or the React hook is asynchronous.

#### Suggested Fixes
1. Search for any mention of “70” or a fallback within weather display components.  
2. Confirm the hook or context that supplies weather data is returning the same data used in the shot calculator.  
3. Ensure the component re-renders by verifying no stale references or early returns.  
4. Log the real-time data in the console to confirm it’s actually 58°F before re-checking the UI.

### 2. Validating the Calculations

• The user also wanted to confirm the shot calculator’s math is correct.  
• Typical checks for a golf shot calculator involve verifying:  
  - Launch angle to trajectory conversion (degrees to radians).  
  - Air density calculations (temperature, humidity, altitude, pressure).  
  - Correct usage of wind data in formulas (headwind/crosswind).  
  - No mismatch between metric/imperial units.

#### Suggested Fixes
1. Compare the calculator’s results with a known baseline (e.g., real-world data or a simpler known formula).  
2. Implement small test cases that specifically check for zero wind, specific altitudes, or extreme temperatures to confirm correct outputs.  
3. Inspect any external library calls (e.g., for ballistic or physics calculations) to ensure they use the right parameter format (Fahrenheit vs. Celsius, mph vs. m/s, etc.).  
4. Log intermediate variables for debugging (like velocity, flight time, distance) in a dev environment to confirm consistency.

### 3. Wind Calculator: Locking Angle, Speed, and Excessive Decimal Places

• The user reported that the Wind Calculator screen “locks” angle and speed, preventing decimal entry, and that results sometimes show too many decimals.  

#### Why This Happens
1. The component may be using math functions (like Math.round or parseInt) that strip decimals from user input or internal calculations.  
2. The displayed values might be direct floating-point results with many trailing decimals and no formatting.

#### How to Fix It
1. Switch integer parsing to parseFloat if decimals are desired.  
2. Use .toFixed(n) to limit the displayed decimals, e.g. .toFixed(1) or .toFixed(2).  
3. Allow the user to input decimals by changing input type properties and removing constraints like step=“1”, if present.  
4. If you still want an integer internally, store decimals in state for display, then round only at the final calculation step.

Sample Code Excerpt (for the wind input fields):
typescript
<label>Wind Speed (mph)</label>
<input
type="number"
step="0.1" // Let user enter decimal increments
value={windData.speed}
onChange={(e) => setWindData({ ...windData, speed: e.target.value })}
/>
// Then parse as float in calculations:
const windSpeed = parseFloat(windData.speed) || 0;
const finalSpeed = Number(windSpeed.toFixed(1)); // Display 1 decimal place
