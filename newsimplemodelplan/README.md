# New Simplified Model Implementation Plan

This folder contains the implementation plan and steps for creating an enhanced simplified physics model by extracting and optimizing code from our advanced physics system.

## Documents

### enhanced-physics-implementation-plan.md
Technical implementation plan containing:
- Source code examples
- Data structures
- Lookup tables
- Class implementations
- Architecture details

### implementation-steps.md
Day-by-day breakdown of tasks including:
- Morning/afternoon objectives
- Specific files to extract from
- Validation steps
- Success metrics

## Implementation Strategy
The plan uses direct code extraction from our advanced physics system:
1. Extract pre-computed coefficients and lookup tables
2. Simplify complex calculations through caching
3. Optimize for mobile performance
4. Maintain high accuracy through validated data

## Source Files Used
- aerodynamics-forces.ts
- wind-effects.ts
- environmental-system.ts
- spin-dynamics.ts
- trackman-validation.ts
- weather-system.ts
- surface-effects.ts
- launch-physics.ts

## Timeline
- Day 1: Core Physics Extraction
- Day 2: Environmental System
- Day 3: Integration & Testing
- Day 4: Performance Optimization
- Day 5: Final Implementation

## Success Criteria
- Calculation time: < 10ms
- Memory usage: < 50MB
- Accuracy vs advanced: > 95%
- Cache hit rate: > 90%

## Getting Started
1. Review enhanced-physics-implementation-plan.md for technical details
2. Follow implementation-steps.md for day-by-day tasks
3. Use validation checklist to verify implementation
4. Monitor success metrics throughout development
