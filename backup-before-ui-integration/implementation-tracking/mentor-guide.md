# Project Structure

## Backend (This Repository)
This repository contains the physics engine and API endpoints. It:
- Runs on http://localhost:3001
- Provides real-time physics calculations
- Exposes weather data via REST API
- Handles all complex computations

## Your UI (Separate Repository)
Your UI should remain in its own repository and:
- Connect to this backend via API calls
- Use http://localhost:3001/api/environment for weather data
- Keep all its existing code and structure
- Just update the fetch URL to point to our endpoint

# Integration Steps

1. Keep Backend Running:
```bash
# In this directory (c:/compare backend)
npm run dev

# You should see:
Server running on port 3001
```

2. In Your UI Code:
```typescript
// Change your weather fetch URL to:
const WEATHER_API = 'http://localhost:3001/api/environment';

// Your fetch code stays the same:
const response = await fetch(WEATHER_API);
const data = await response.json();

// You'll get back:
{
  "temperature": {
    "current": 75.5,
    "feelsLike": 77.5,
    "units": "F"
  },
  "humidity": {
    "value": 80,
    "units": "%"
  },
  "pressure": {
    "value": 1013.09,
    "units": "hPa"
  },
  "altitude": {
    "value": 221,
    "units": "ft"
  },
  "airDensity": {
    "value": 0.0342,
    "units": "kg/m¬≥"
  }
}
```

# Testing the Integration

1. Backend Checks:
- Server running on port 3001
- No TypeScript errors
- Clean terminal output

2. API Checks:
- http://localhost:3001/api/environment works
- JSON data looks correct
- All values present

3. UI Checks:
- Can fetch from localhost
- No CORS errors
- Values display correctly

# Development Workflow

1. Backend Development (This Repo):
- Physics engine improvements
- API endpoint changes
- Performance optimizations

2. UI Development (Your Repo):
- Keep all your existing code
- Just update the API endpoint URL
- Everything else stays the same

This separation lets us:
- Deploy backend and UI independently
- Scale each part separately
- Keep codebases clean and focused
- Test each part in isolation

Need to restart the backend? Just run `npm run dev` again! üèåÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚ú®
