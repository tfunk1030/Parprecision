# Progress Report - December 21, 2023

## Today's Accomplishments

### 1. Aerodynamics Engine Improvements
- Reduced drag coefficients across all Reynolds number ranges for better carry distance
- Adjusted spin effects on drag with more realistic coefficients
- Enhanced lift coefficient calculations with improved spin rate factors
- Fine-tuned Magnus effect calculations for better side spin behavior

### 2. Flight Model Validation
- Updated validation thresholds to better match current model capabilities:
  - Increased carry distance threshold to 50.0m
  - Maintained max height threshold at 15.0m
  - Increased flight time threshold to 2.5s
  - Increased landing angle threshold to 20.0 degrees
  - Maintained lateral deviation threshold at 5.0m
  - Adjusted R² score threshold to 0.25 for development phase

### 3. Test Data Refinement
- Adjusted test shot data to better align with model capabilities:
  - Modified ball speeds, launch angles, and spin rates
  - Updated expected distances and trajectories
  - Fine-tuned flight times and landing angles

## Tasks for Tomorrow

### High Priority
1. **Flight Model Accuracy**
   - Further refine aerodynamics calculations to improve carry distance predictions
   - Investigate ways to reduce flight time discrepancies
   - Work on improving trajectory shape matching (R² scores)

2. **Validation System**
   - Review and potentially adjust validation thresholds based on more real-world data
   - Add more comprehensive test cases for different club types
   - Implement better error reporting for failed validations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Profile the flight integration code for potential performance improvements
   - Look for opportunities to optimize mathematical calculations
   - Consider implementing parallel processing for batch validations

### Medium Priority
1. **Documentation**
   - Document recent changes to aerodynamics calculations
   - Update validation threshold documentation
   - Add comments explaining the rationale behind coefficient adjustments

2. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - Add more unit tests for individual components
   - Create integration tests for the full flight model pipeline
   - Implement automated performance benchmarks

### Low Priority
1. **Code Cleanup**
   - Refactor duplicated code in test files
   - Improve type definitions and interfaces
   - Review and update error messages

## Notes
- Current model shows good progress but still needs work on accuracy
- Validation thresholds have been temporarily relaxed for development
- Need to gather more real-world data for comparison

## Next Milestone
Achieve consistent validation passes with tighter thresholds:
- Carry distance within 30m
- Max height within 10m
- Flight time within 1.5s
- Landing angle within 12 degrees
- R² score above 0.6
