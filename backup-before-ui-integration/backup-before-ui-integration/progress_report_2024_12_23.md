## Next Steps

### Immediate Focus (Next 24-48 Hours)
1. Complete API documentation
   - Highest priority as it's completely missing
   - Required for external developer usage
   - Needed for maintainability

2. Implement cache analytics
   - Critical for production performance
   - Needed for memory optimization
   - Required for scaling decisions

3. Create performance monitoring
   - Essential for production deployment
   - Required for optimization decisions
   - Needed for resource management

### Medium-Term Goals (Next Week)
1. Hardware-specific optimizations
2. GPU acceleration framework
3. Cache persistence implementation

## Notes
- Core physics implementation is complete and validated
- Test infrastructure is comprehensive and robust
- Focus should be on production readiness and documentation
- No major physics changes needed at this time
