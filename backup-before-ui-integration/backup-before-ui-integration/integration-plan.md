# Integration Plan: Moving UI into Physics Engine Project

## Benefits of This Approach

1. Unified Development:
   - Single repository for all code
   - Easier to maintain version control
   - Simpler deployment process

2. Direct Integration:
   - No need for complex API routes
   - Direct access to physics calculations
   - Better type safety across the codebase

3. Development Workflow:
   - Single development server
   - Shared dependencies
   - Easier debugging

4. Project Structure:
```
c:/compare backend/
├── src/
│   ├── core/              # Physics engine (existing)
│   │   ├── types.ts
│   │   ├── simplified-shot-model.ts
│   │   └── environmental-calculator.ts
│   │
│   └── ui/               # Next.js UI (to be moved)
│       ├── app/          # Pages and routes
│       ├── components/   # React components
│       └── lib/         # Shared utilities
│
├── package.json          # Combined dependencies
└── tsconfig.json        # Unified TypeScript config
```

## Implementation Steps

1. Move UI Files:
   - Copy Next.js app structure
   - Update import paths
   - Merge dependencies

2. Update Configuration:
   - Combine TypeScript configs
   - Set up proper module resolution
   - Configure build process

3. Development Setup:
   - Single npm start command
   - Unified testing
   - Shared types

This approach gives us:
- Better code organization
- Simpler development process
- More reliable integration
- Easier maintenance
