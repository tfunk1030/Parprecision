# Testing Approaches Comparison

## 1. Automated Testing First

### Benefits:
1. Early Issue Detection:
   - Catches calculation errors immediately
   - Identifies type mismatches
   - Validates all edge cases systematically

2. Regression Prevention:
   - Ensures changes don't break existing functionality
   - Provides confidence in future modifications
   - Documents expected behavior

3. Development Speed:
   - Faster iteration once tests are set up
   - Immediate feedback on changes
   - No manual testing needed for basic functionality

4. Documentation:
   - Tests serve as documentation
   - Clear examples of how to use the API
   - Shows expected input/output formats

### Drawbacks:
1. Initial Setup Time:
   - Need to install and configure vitest
   - Set up test environment
   - Write comprehensive test cases

2. Learning Curve:
   - Team needs to understand test framework
   - May need to mock dependencies
   - Additional configuration needed

## 2. Manual Testing First

### Benefits:
1. Immediate Feedback:
   - Can test endpoint right away
   - Visual verification of results
   - Real-world usage patterns

2. Flexibility:
   - Easy to try different scenarios
   - Quick adjustments possible
   - No test setup needed

3. UI Integration:
   - Can test with actual UI components
   - Verify real user experience
   - Catch integration issues early

### Drawbacks:
1. Time Consuming:
   - Manual testing takes longer
   - Need to repeat tests after changes
   - Hard to test all edge cases

2. Inconsistency:
   - Manual tests may miss cases
   - Different testers may test differently
   - No automated verification

## Recommendation

A hybrid approach might be best:
1. Quick manual test to verify basic functionality
2. Set up automated tests for regression
3. Continue development with both:
   - Automated tests for core functionality
   - Manual testing for UI integration

This gives us:
- Fast initial verification
- Long-term reliability
- Comprehensive coverage
- Best of both approaches
