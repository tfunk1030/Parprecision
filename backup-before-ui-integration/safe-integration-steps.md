# Safe Integration Strategy

## 1. Backup First
Before making any changes:
- Create a backup of our current project
- Git commit all current changes
- Document current working state

## 2. Isolated Integration
We'll keep the physics engine completely separate:
```
c:/compare backend/
├── src/
│   ├── core/           # Existing physics engine (untouched)
│   │   ├── types.ts
│   │   ├── simplified-shot-model.ts
│   │   └── ...
│   │
│   └── ui/            # New UI directory (completely separate)
│       ├── app/
│       └── ...
```

## 3. Safe Package Management
- Keep all existing dependencies
- Add UI dependencies without modifying existing ones
- Use separate tsconfig for UI if needed

## 4. Reversible Changes
Every step will be:
- Isolated (won't affect core code)
- Documented (easy to undo)
- Tested before proceeding

## 5. Verification Steps
After each change:
1. Verify physics engine still works
2. Run existing tests
3. Check build process
4. Ensure no dependency conflicts

## Why This Is Safe

1. No Modification of Existing Code:
- Core physics stays untouched
- Only adding new files
- No changes to existing logic

2. Separate Concerns:
- UI code in isolated directory
- Clear separation of responsibilities
- Independent development possible

3. Easy Rollback:
- Can remove UI directory if needed
- No core changes to revert
- Clean separation makes rollback simple

4. Development Safety:
- Can develop UI without affecting physics
- Test both parts independently
- Merge only when ready

Would you like me to proceed with these safety measures in place?
