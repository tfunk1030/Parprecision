# Physics Model Comparison

## Proposed Full Physics Model vs. Existing Systems

### LastShot System
```javascript
// LastShot's wind approach
const windProfile = calculateWindGradient(windSpeed, altitude);
const turbulence = calculateTurbulence(windSpeed, stability, temperature);
```
**Similarities:**
- Uses wind gradient calculations
- Considers turbulence
- Has basic temperature effects

**Key Differences:**
- LastShot uses simplified wind gradient (power law)
- Missing true Magnus force calculations
- No real-time air density computations
- Lacks complete differential equations for trajectory

### Test-Yardage System
```javascript
// Test-yardage's approach
const windEffect = -(headwindComponent * 1.8);
const tempEffect = (tempDiff * 0.001) * shotDistance;
```
**Similarities:**
- Basic wind decomposition
- Simple temperature scaling

**Key Differences:**
- Test-yardage uses pure empirical formulas
- No physics modeling at all
- Missing all complex environmental factors
- No trajectory calculations

### ChatGPT System
```cpp
// ChatGPT's approach
double relativeEffect = (currentSpeed / (ballVelocity + currentSpeed + 1.0)) * heightFactor;
```
**Similarities:**
- Attempts physics-based calculations
