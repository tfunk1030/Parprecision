# Hybrid Shot Model Implementation Plan

## Overview
Replace the simplified shot model with the new hybrid model that combines accurate club data with proper environmental physics while maintaining mobile performance.

## Changes Required

1. Core Model Updates:
- Replace `src/core/simplified-shot-model.ts` with new hybrid model
- Copy club data and environmental constants from lookup model
- Ensure all interfaces match existing API

2. UI Integration:
- Update `../perfect-ui/lib/simplified-model/simplified-shot-model.ts` to use hybrid model
- Maintain same method signatures for backward compatibility
- Keep existing UI components unchanged

3. API Updates:
- Update `../perfect-ui/app/api/shot-calculator/calculate/route.ts` to use hybrid model
- Ensure response format matches existing API

## Validation Steps

1. Test Coverage:
- Environmental effects match real-world data
  * Temperature: ±2% per 20°F from standard
  * Altitude: -2% per 1000ft with proper spin effects
  * Wind: Vector-based calculations with proper coefficients

2. Performance Metrics:
- Calculation time under 100ms on mobile devices
- Memory usage within mobile constraints
- No external API calls or heavy computations

3. Accuracy Verification:
- Club recommendations match PGA averages
- Environmental adjustments match empirical data
- Wind effects align with aerodynamic models

## Benefits

1. Improved Accuracy:
- Uses real club data for distances and trajectories
- Applies proper environmental physics
- Maintains computational efficiency

2. Better Recommendations:
- More accurate club selection
- Proper adjustments for conditions
- Realistic distance ranges

3. Mobile-Friendly:
- No heavy physics calculations
- Uses pre-computed lookup data
- Efficient environmental adjustments

## Migration Steps

1. Phase 1: Core Implementation
- Implement hybrid model in core
- Add comprehensive tests
- Validate accuracy against lookup model

2. Phase 2: UI Integration
- Update UI components to use hybrid model
- Maintain existing interfaces
- Verify UI behavior unchanged

3. Phase 3: API Updates
- Update API endpoints
- Validate response formats
- Test API performance

4. Phase 4: Validation
- Run full test suite
- Verify mobile performance
- Document accuracy improvements

## Rollback Plan

1. Keep simplified model as backup
2. Monitor performance metrics
3. Maintain compatibility layer
4. Document reversion process

## Success Criteria

1. Accuracy:
- Temperature effects within ±1% of real data
- Altitude effects match empirical measurements
- Wind calculations match aerodynamic models

2. Performance:
- Calculation time < 100ms
- Memory usage < 10MB
- No runtime errors

3. User Experience:
- Seamless transition
- No UI changes required
- Improved recommendations
