# Enhanced Shot Model Analysis

## Current Status

After implementing various physics improvements:

1. Ball Launch Conditions:
- Driver: 78.2 m/s (175 mph), 15° launch, 2700 rpm
- 7-Iron: 57.0 m/s (128 mph), 20° launch, 6500 rpm

2. Physics Components:
- RK4 integration with 1ms timesteps
- Enhanced Magnus effect with vertical bias
- Reduced drag coefficient for dimples
- Adjusted gravity effect

3. Results:
- Driver: ~106 yards (Expected: 230-330)
- 7-Iron: ~83 yards (Expected: 140-200)

## Analysis

The significant distance shortfall suggests fundamental issues:

1. Force Balance:
- Lift forces may be insufficient to overcome gravity
- Drag reduction might not be aggressive enough
- Magnus effect might need different scaling

2. Possible Solutions:
- Study advanced model implementation
- Analyze real-world ball flight data
- Consider additional aerodynamic effects:
  * Ground effect near landing
  * Air density variation with height
  * Temperature effects on ball compression

3. Next Steps:
1. Obtain access to advanced physics model
2. Compare force calculations step by step
3. Analyze trajectory shapes
4. Study real PGA Tour data

## Recommendations

1. Short Term:
- Keep current model for testing
- Add detailed logging of forces
- Compare with advanced model

2. Long Term:
- Consider hybrid approach:
  * Use advanced model for accuracy
  * Cache results for performance
  * Interpolate between cached results

3. Mobile Considerations:
- Current model is efficient but inaccurate
- Need to find better balance between:
  * Physics accuracy
  * Computational cost
  * Memory usage
