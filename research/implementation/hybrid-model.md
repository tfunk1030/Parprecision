# Hybrid Golf Ball Flight Model

## Core Concept
Combine physics-based accuracy with practical implementation.

### 1. Pre-Computed Tables
```python
class FlightTables:
    """Pre-computed lookup tables for common conditions"""
    
    # Ball Speed (mph) | Launch (°) | Spin (rpm) | Carry (yards)
    STANDARD_CONDITIONS = {
        (150, 12, 2500): {'carry': 245, 'total': 268},
        (160, 11.8, 2400): {'carry': 265, 'total': 290},
        # More entries based on wind tunnel data
    }
    
    # Temperature adjustment factors
    TEMP_FACTORS = {
        40: 0.972,  # -2.8%
        50: 0.981,  # -1.9%
        60: 0.990,  # -1.0%
        70: 1.000,  # Baseline
        80: 1.009,  # +0.9%
        90: 1.018   # +1.8%
    }
    
    # Altitude adjustment factors (per 1000ft)
    ALTITUDE_FACTORS = {
        0: 1.000,
        1: 1.021,
        2: 1.042,
        3: 1.064,
        4: 1.086
    }
```

### 2. Fast Physics Approximations
```python
class QuickPhysics:
    """Simplified physics for real-time calculations"""
    
    def adjust_for_wind(self,
        base_distance: float,
        wind_speed: float,
        wind_angle: float
    ) -> float:
        # Quick wind adjustment based on research
        # Headwind: -2.5 yards per 5mph
        # Tailwind: +2.0 yards per 5mph
        # Crosswind: Curve based on speed
        
    def adjust_for_spin(self,
        base_trajectory: dict,
        spin_rate: float,
        spin_axis: float
    ) -> dict:
        # Quick spin effects based on research
        # Backspin: Height and carry adjustments
        # Sidespin: Curve calculations
```

### 3. Smart Caching System
```python
class TrajectoryCache:
    """Cache common shot patterns"""
    
    def get_cached_trajectory(self,
        launch_conditions: LaunchConditions,
        environment: BasicEnvironment
    ) -> Optional[TrajectoryResult]:
        # Check cache for similar conditions
        # Return pre-computed result if close match
        # Otherwise calculate new trajectory
```

### 4. Adaptive Calculation System
```python
class AdaptiveCalculator:
    """Choose calculation method based on conditions"""
    
    def calculate_trajectory(self,
        launch_conditions: LaunchConditions,
        environment: Environment,
        accuracy_need: AccuracyLevel
    ) -> TrajectoryResult:
        if accuracy_need == AccuracyLevel.QUICK:
            return self.quick_calculation()
        elif accuracy_need == AccuracyLevel.STANDARD:
            return self.standard_calculation()
        else:
            return self.full_physics_calculation()
```

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Base Calculations
- Use pre-computed tables for standard conditions
- Interpolate between known values
- Quick adjustments for basic factors

### 2. Environmental Adjustments
- Simple multiplication factors for temperature
- Basic wind calculations
- Altitude adjustments from lookup

### 3. Spin Effects
- Simplified spin calculations
- Pre-computed curve patterns
- Quick adjustments for non-standard spin

### 4. Advanced Features (Optional)
- Full physics for special cases
- Detailed calculations when needed
- Background processing for accuracy

## Performance Targets

### Speed
- Basic calculation: <10ms
- Standard calculation: <50ms
- Full physics: <200ms

### Memory Usage
- Base tables: <5MB
- Cache: <20MB
- Total system: <50MB

### Accuracy
- Quick mode: ±3 yards
- Standard mode: ±2 yards
- Full physics: ±1 yard

## Validation Process

### 1. Compare Against Research
```python
def validate_against_research():
    """Validate calculations against wind tunnel data"""
    test_cases = load_test_cases()
    for case in test_cases:
        quick_result = quick_calculate(case)
        full_result = full_calculate(case)
        compare_results(quick_result, full_result)
```

### 2. Real-World Validation
```python
def validate_real_world():
    """Validate against TrackMan data"""
    trackman_data = load_trackman_data()
    for shot in trackman_data:
        predicted = calculate_trajectory(shot.launch)
        compare_results(predicted, shot.actual)
```

## Usage Example
```python
# Quick calculation for mobile app
result = trajectory_calculator.calculate({
    'ball_speed': 150,
    'launch_angle': 12,
    'spin_rate': 2500,
    'wind_speed': 5,
    'wind_direction': 45,
    'temperature': 70
})

# Returns within 10ms:
{
    'carry': 245,
    'total': 268,
    'height': 29,
    'curve': 3,
    'accuracy': '±3 yards'
}
```

## Benefits
