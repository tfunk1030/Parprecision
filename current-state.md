# Current Project State Before UI Integration

## Core Components Working
1. Physics Engine:
   - Simplified shot model
   - Environmental calculations
   - Wind effects
   - Club recommendations

2. Type System:
   - Environment interfaces
   - Ball properties
   - Vector calculations
   - Standard conditions

3. File Structure:
```
src/
├── core/
│   ├── simplified-shot-model.ts   # Core physics calculations
│   ├── environmental-calculator.ts # Environmental effects
│   └── types.ts                   # Shared interfaces
```

## Working Features
1. Shot Calculations:
   - Distance adjustments
   - Environmental effects
   - Wind calculations
   - Club recommendations

2. Environmental System:
   - Temperature effects
   - Altitude adjustments
   - Air density calculations
   - Wind vector processing

3. Data Types:
   - All interfaces defined
   - Standard conditions set
   - Unit conversions handled

## Next Steps for UI Integration

1. Create UI Directory:
```
src/
├── core/          # Existing physics (untouched)
└── ui/           # New Next.js UI
    ├── app/      # Pages
    ├── lib/      # Shared utilities
    └── public/   # Static assets
```

2. Dependencies to Add:
- Next.js
- React
- TailwindCSS
- TypeScript configurations

3. Integration Points:
- Direct import of physics models
- Shared type system
- Environmental calculations
- Shot processing

## Backup Location
- Full project backup: `./backup-before-ui-integration/`
- Can restore if needed

## Current Working State
- All tests passing
- Types properly exported
- Calculations verified
- Documentation updated

This state has been preserved in the backup directory and can be restored if needed during the integration process.
