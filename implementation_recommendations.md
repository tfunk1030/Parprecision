# Golf Ball Flight Implementation Recommendations

## Optimal Implementation Approach

Based on professional golf standards and analysis of both systems, here's the recommended implementation:

```typescript
interface EnvironmentalConditions {
    temperature: number;    // Fahrenheit
    windSpeed: number;      // MPH
    windDirection: number;  // Degrees (0 = N, 90 = E)
    altitude: number;       // Feet
    humidity: number;       // Percentage
}

class FlightCalculator {
    private readonly BASE_TEMP = 70;  // Â°F
    
    calculateShotAdjustments(
        shotDistance: number,
        conditions: EnvironmentalConditions,
        shotDirection: number  // Degrees
    ): ShotAdjustments {
        // 1. Wind Effects
        const windEffect = this.calculateWindEffect(
            conditions.windSpeed,
            conditions.windDirection,
            shotDirection,
            shotDistance
        );

        // 2. Temperature Effect
        const tempEffect = this.calculateTemperatureEffect(
            conditions.temperature,
            shotDistance
        );

        // 3. Altitude Effect
        const altitudeEffect = this.calculateAltitudeEffect(
            conditions.altitude,
            shotDistance
        );

        return {
            totalEffect: windEffect + tempEffect + altitudeEffect,
            windEffect,
            tempEffect,
            altitudeEffect
        };
    }

    private calculateWindEffect(
        windSpeed: number,
        windDirection: number,
        shotDirection: number,
        shotDistance: number
    ): number {
        // Convert angles to radians
        const windAngle = (windDirection * Math.PI) / 180;
        const shotAngle = (shotDirection * Math.PI) / 180;
        const relativeAngle = windAngle - shotAngle;

        // Calculate head/tail wind component
        const headwindComponent = windSpeed * Math.cos(relativeAngle);
        
        // Calculate crosswind component
        const crosswindComponent = windSpeed * Math.sin(relativeAngle);

        // Pro standard: 1% per mph headwind, 0.5% per mph tailwind
        const headwindEffect = headwindComponent > 0
            ? -(headwindComponent * 0.01 * shotDistance)  // Headwind
            : -(headwindComponent * 0.005 * shotDistance); // Tailwind

        // Pro standard: 2% per 5mph crosswind
        const crosswindEffect = (crosswindComponent * 0.004 * shotDistance);

        return headwindEffect + crosswindEffect;
    }

    private calculateTemperatureEffect(
        temperature: number,
        shotDistance: number
    ): number {
        // Pro standard: 2 yards per 10 degrees
        const tempDiff = temperature - this.BASE_TEMP;
        return (tempDiff / 10) * 2;
    }

    private calculateAltitudeEffect(
        altitude: number,
        shotDistance: number
    ): number {
        // Pro standard: 10% per 5000 feet
        return (altitude / 5000) * 0.10 * shotDistance;
    }
}

// Usage Example:
const calculator = new FlightCalculator();

const conditions: EnvironmentalConditions = {
    temperature: 80,      // 10 degrees above base
    windSpeed: 10,        // 10 mph
    windDirection: 0,     // Direct headwind
    altitude: 5000,       // 5000 feet elevation
    humidity: 50
};

const shotDistance = 150;  // yards
const shotDirection = 0;   // degrees

const adjustments = calculator.calculateShotAdjustments(
    shotDistance,
    conditions,
    shotDirection
);

/* Expected Results for 150-yard shot:
   - Temperature: +2 yards (2 yards per 10 degrees)
   - Headwind: -15 yards (1% per mph = 1.5 yards per mph)
   - Altitude: +15 yards (10% at 5000 feet)
   Total Adjustment: +2 yards
*/
```

## Key Features

1. **Exact Pro Standards Implementation**
   - Temperature: 2 yards per 10 degrees
   - Headwind: 1% per mph
   - Tailwind: 0.5% per mph
   - Crosswind: 2% per 5mph
   - Altitude: 10% per 5000 feet

2. **Clean, Maintainable Code**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Well-documented calculations
   - Easy to modify and calibrate

3. **Practical Considerations**
   - All calculations based on empirical observations
   - Easy to validate against real-world results
   - Simple to integrate with any UI system

## Integration Notes

1. **UI Implementation**
   - Add input validation for all environmental conditions
   - Provide visual feedback for each adjustment factor
   - Include presets for common conditions

2. **Performance Optimization**
   - Calculations are lightweight and suitable for real-time updates
   - Consider caching results for frequently used combinations
   - Add memoization for expensive calculations if needed

3. **Testing Strategy**
   - Unit tests should verify each adjustment individually
   - Integration tests should check combined effects
   - Test edge cases (extreme temperatures, wind speeds, etc.)

## Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Factors**
   - Rain effect on ball flight
   - Grass conditions impact
   - Elevation change between tee and target

2. **Advanced Features**
   - Shot shape considerations (draw/fade)
   - Club-specific adjustments
   - Player tendency factors

This implementation provides a perfect balance between accuracy and simplicity, matching professional golf standards while remaining easy to maintain and modify.
